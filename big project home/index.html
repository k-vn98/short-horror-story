        â€˜Twas was midnight, everyone is sleeping but you. You have stayed awake long past your bedtime. You should sleep, but first, you must eat something, god forbid you sleep hungry. You need to cross the park, visit the general store in front of your apartment and steal some cheap ramen. No one should be awake, this task should be plenty simple. Now, go on, you starving soldier.
